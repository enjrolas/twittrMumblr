This sketch gets tweets from a certain location and uses Apple's
text-to-speech engine to read them out.  It's like the internet is
talking to you!

This requires the [twitter4j
library](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html).  There are [some good
instructions here](http://saglamdeniz.com/blog/?p=124) on how to install it (not that tricky)

Another lovely morning project
